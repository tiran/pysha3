Changelog
=========

pysha3 0.4
----------

*Release date: ??-???-2012*

- Add KAT files for additional tests.

- Add experimental HMAC support based on examples from
  http://www.di-mgt.com.au/hmac_sha3_testvectors.html . HMAC-SHA-3 isn't
  standardized yet and disabled unless the module is compiled with
  SHA3_HMAC_SUPPORT flag.

- Test hashing of unaligned data.

- Add ISO C11 memset_s() function as _Py_memset_s() in order to securely
  wipe memory that holds sensitive data. The page
  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/MSC06-C.+Be+aware+of+compiler+optimization+when+dealing+with+sensitive+data
  explains the motivation for memset_s().

- Add tox support

- Add _capacity_bits and _rate_bits attributes for diagnostic purposes

- Add SHA3_0 support and sha3_0.squeeze(lenght, hex=False) method for
  arbitrary-length sponge squeezing. SHA3_0 uses a capacity of 1024 and a rate
  of 576.


pysha3 0.3
----------

*Release date: 14-Oct-2012*

- Fix 64bit big endian support

- Add workaround for alignment error on 64bit SPARC machine by using the opt32
  implementation.

- block_size now returns NotImplemented to prevent users from using pysha3
  with the hmac module.


pysha3 0.2.2
------------

*Release date: 07-Oct-2012*

- Re-add brg_endian.h to fix issue on Solaris (big endian platform)


pysha3 0.2.1
------------

*Release date: 06-Oct-2012*

- Fix MANIFEST.in to include Makefile and tests.py

- Add setup.py test command with hack for inplace builds

- Enhance README.txt and fixed its markup


pysha3 0.2
----------

*Release date: 06-Oct-2012*

- Change directory struct to use the same directory layout as Python 3.4.

- Remove C++ comments from Keccak sources for ANSI C compatibility.

- Declare all Keccak functions and globals as static to avoid name clashes.

- Remove alias sha3() for sha3_512().

- Add block_size attribute. Keccak has a internal sponge size of 1600 bits.

- Release GIL around SHA3_update() calls.

- Monkey patch the hashlib module to support, e.g. hashlib.sha3_512() and
  hashlib.new("sha3_512")

- Release GIL around SHA3_update() when the data exceeds a certain size.

- Fix build on platforms with an unsigned 64bit integer type (uint64_t). The
  module falls back to 32bit implementation of Keccak with interleave tables.


pysha3 0.1
----------

*Release date: 04-Oct-2012*

- first release

- based on KeccakReferenceAndOptimized-3.2.zip
