pysha3 0.2
----------

*Release date: 06-Oct-2012*

- Change directory struct to use the same directory layout as Python 3.4.

- Remove C++ comments from Keccak sources for ANSI C compatibility.

- Declare all Keccak functions and globals as static to avoid name clashes.

- Remove alias sha3() for sha3_512().

- Add block_size attribute. Keccak has a internal sponge size of 1600 bits.

- Release GIL around SHA3_update() calls.

- Monkey patch the hashlib module to support, e.g. hashlib.sha3_512() and
  hashlib.new("sha3_512")

- Release GIL around SHA3_update() when the data exceeds a certain size.

- Fix build on platforms with an unsigned 64bit integer type (uint64_t). The
  module falls back to 32bit implementation of Keccak with interleave tables.
